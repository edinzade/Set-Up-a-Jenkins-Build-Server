# Set Up a Jenkins Build Server

# You can use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) to deploy a Jenkins application on AWS in a matter of minutes.

Step 1
To prepare for this tutorial, you will need an AWS account, an AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) user name and password, an Amazon EC2 key pair, and a configured Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). Detailed instructions can be found in Setting Up to Host a Web App on AWS.1


Step 2: Launch an EC2 Instance

Create a Security Group for Your Amazon EC2
Instance A security group acts as a firewall that controls the traffic allowed to reach one or more EC2 instances. 
1.Allow inbound HTTP access from anywhere
2.Allow inbound SSH traffic from your computer's public IP address so
that you can connect to your instance

# Launch Your EC2 Instance
 
 Step 3: Install and Configure Jenkins 

 Before you connect to your instance, get the public DNS name of the instance using the Amazon EC2 console. Select the instance and locate Public DNS on the Description tab.
 To Connect to Your Instance from Linux or Mac OS X Using SSH
1. Use the ssh command to connect to the instance. You will specify the private key (.pem) file and ec2-user@public_dns_name.
